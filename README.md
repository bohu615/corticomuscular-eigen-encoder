# Learning Cortico-Muscular Dependence through Orthonormal Decomposition of Density Ratios 

## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our paper *Learning Cortico-Muscular Dependence through Orthonormal Decomposition of Density Ratios*. Here, you will find datasets, models, and codes for training and visualization as described in the paper. ðŸ§ ðŸ’ª

The repository is structured with notebook files for training and visualization, organized as follows:

- **1.1. Preprocessing** âœ… 
- **2.1 Main Experiment - Inter Subject Experiments** âœ… 
- **2.2 Main Experiment - Cross Subject Experiments** âœ… 
- **3.1 Visualization - Span of Eigenfunctions** âœ…

## Getting Started

### 1. Preprocessing
#### Downloadable Files:
- **Raw Data**: https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giaa098
- **Filtered EEG/EMG Numpy Arrays**: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e0nqKcb7MoAJQd4aaEAfbvKjzURMVkyH?usp=sharing
- **Trained Models**: 

#### Processing Steps:
1. Download the necessary raw data files: `eeg_train_trial.pt`, `emg_filtered_train_trial.pt`, `label_train_trial.pt`, `sub_train_trial.pt`, and update the paths accordingly.
2. Execute the blocks in `Preprocessing.ipynb` to save filtered signals (outliers removed) and primary movement labels as numpy arrays.

### 2. Running Experiments
#### Inter Subject Experiments:
1. After preprocessing, execute the **Inter Subject Experiments** notebook section by section.
2. This will store the trained models and learning curves locally.
3. **Note**: Inter Subject is used for visualizations and must be run before visualization.

#### Cross Subject Experiments:
1. Running the **Cross Subject Experiments** notebook will save the highest accuracies during training.

### 3. Visualization
#### Span of Eigenfunctions:
1. Load the trained models and extract training and testing set features for both EEG and EMG data.
2. Use EEG features for visualizations.

##### Produced Figures:
- Projection of all samples, color-coded by subject index and movement types.
- Specific projections of individual subjects and their movements.
- Approximated density ratios values.

#### Temporal-Level and Channel-Level Dependencies:
1. Use the saved model from **Inter Subject Experiments (2.1)**.
2. Produce temporal-level and channel-level dependencies figures.

### 4. Baseline:
- Contains codes for **CMC** and **MINE**.

Happy Experimenting!
